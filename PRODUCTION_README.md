## Known Gaps (Must Fix Before Production)

### 1. Order History Uses Mock Data
**File:** `app/dashboard/order-history/page.tsx`
- Currently displays hardcoded sample data
- Needs to fetch from `/api/orders` endpoint

### 2. Missing Order Details Page
**Missing:** `app/dashboard/orders/[id]/page.tsx`
- Notifications link to this non-existent page
- Customers clicking order notifications get 404

### 3. Installation Items Not Created
**File:** `app/api/orders/[id]/route.ts`
- When order → completed, creates Installation record
- Does NOT create InstallationRider/InstallationLockbox records
- Customer inventory not updated (in_storage → in_use)

### 4. No Customer Service Requests Page
**Missing:** `app/dashboard/service-requests/page.tsx`
- Customers can only view requests via Installation Details modal
- No dedicated page to see all their service requests

### Medium Priority Issues
| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| No status validation | Orders can transition to any status |
| Payment failure handling | No notification on Stripe payment failure |
| No scheduling UI | Admin can't set scheduledDate after order creation |
| Expedited orders | Not highlighted in admin order list |
